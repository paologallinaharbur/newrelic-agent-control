# Package Manager

Agent Control (AC) manages agent packages (and in the future agent types) distributed as OCI ([Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/)) artifacts.
The package manager handles download, signature verification, extraction, installation and garbage collection of packages from OCI registries.

## Package structure

The packaged agent must comply with the [OCI image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec). The entrypoint can either
be a [manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md#oci-image-manifest-specification) JSON file or an [index](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md#oci-image-index-specification) JSON file, but for AC we expect the entrypoint to be an `index`. That's the way OCI supports multi-arch.

> [!NOTE]
> The OCI spec has some [rough edges, at least around the multi-arch topic](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/issues/1538).

The `index` file includes a list of manifest files. AC expects:

* each manifest entry in the array to have a `platform` section with the `architecture` and `os` fields

  Check fields and possible values in the [Image Index Property Descriptions section of the spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md#image-index-property-descriptions). However, to know if AC supports a specific architecture and os, we must look at the [oci_client crate support](https://docs.rs/oci-client/latest/oci_client/manifest/struct.Platform.html) and the [AC compatibility section](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/overview/#requirements-and-compatibility). If it appears on both, then it's supported.

  The section is automatically handled by the [oci_client](https://github.com/oras-project/rust-oci-client/blob/4541487ec759eef2a511e385d95e72e78aa37f69/src/client.rs#L974), which automatically detects the platform and retrieves the correct manifest from the index.

> [!NOTE]
> The `artifactType` field in a given manifest entry of the `index` is not verified by AC, nor by the [client](https://docs.rs/oci-client/latest/oci_client/manifest/struct.ImageIndexEntry.html).

Other than that, it must follow the OCI spec.

Example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json",
  "manifests": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:82677ba32d1276debe264d14ec5f7b1c61e2a9acbc8c6a6dff779d7133ec8487",
      "size": 617,
      "platform": {
        "architecture": "amd64",
        "os": "linux"
      },
      "artifactType": "application/vnd.newrelic.agent.v1"
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:5a16021a5101f7ae0583cddae44ea715ad2cfd618b61b8982de1b847958260da",
      "size": 617,
      "platform": {
        "architecture": "arm64",
        "os": "linux"
      },
      "artifactType": "application/vnd.newrelic.agent.v1"
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:13e6d06647bbaf4f44d4c29bb57e1078c9919da92e2aee3443c122c24b86d3cb",
      "size": 502,
      "platform": {
        "architecture": "amd64",
        "os": "windows"
      },
      "artifactType": "application/vnd.newrelic.agent.v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then we have the `manifest` file, which includes the package data and metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> AC can handle artifacts regardless of the entrypoint (manifest or index).
> However, AC suggests using the index approach. If the author of an agent decides to use a manifest as the entrypoint, they must understand that AC might not behave as expected. The referred artifact will be used in any platform.

There, AC expects to find some specific keys and values.

* `config` must exist, have value `application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json` and contain the `architecture` and `os` [properties](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/config.md#properties)

  ```json
  {
    "architecture": "amd64",
    "os": "linux"
  }
  ```

  This is not required by AC itself. However, it adds support for external tooling. For example, [oras](https://github.com/oras-project/oras). 

* `artifactType` must exist and have value `application/vnd.newrelic.agent.v1`

* `layers/mediaType` must take one of the following values:

  - `application/vnd.newrelic.agent.content.v1.zip`
  - `application/vnd.newrelic.agent.content.v1.tar+gzip`
  - `application/vnd.newrelic.agent-type.content.v1.tar+gzip`

Example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
  "artifactType": "application/vnd.newrelic.agent.v1",
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json",
    "digest": "sha256:7758599fc4d06bd93a65bf28bc98fbff6c559a9a56be1ec3d75ff6aa8a8cfe6e",
    "size": 39
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.newrelic.agent.content.v1.zip",
      "digest": "sha256:2e2e87f3a9403e735bee76c166b7139be36c1a76079f786e21ab2ce138cd9a1a",
      "size": 21678636,
      "annotations": {
        "com.newrelic.artifact.type": "package",
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "newrelic-infra-amd64.zip",
        "org.opencontainers.image.version": "1.71.3"
      }
    }
  ],
  "annotations": {
    "org.opencontainers.image.created": "2026-01-23T08:07:06Z"
  }
}
```

## Package references

Package references are constructed from the data configured in the [AgentType `packages` section](./INTEGRATING_AGENTS.md#packages).

## Package Installation Process

When an agent needs to install or update a package, the package manager leverages the following paths:
```
temp_package_path: <base>/packages/<agent-id>/__temp_packages/<package-id>/<sanitized-ref>
final_path:        <base>/packages/<agent-id>/stored_packages/<package-id>/<sanitized-ref>
```

The `final_path` location is where the extracted package will reside after installation and can be referenced 
by the agent through the variable `${nr-sub:packages.infra-agent.dir}`.

**Steps**:
1. Create temporary download directory
2. Download artifact (expects exactly 1 layer/file), if the file was already downloaded, skip download
3. Create final installation directory
4. Extract archive based on `PackageType` (tar.gz or zip) derived from the MIME type
5. Delete temporary directory (always, even on failure)

The whole operation blocks the sub-agent thread until it terminates.
Notice that the old sub-agent (and therefore the binary) is stopped before the new one is downloaded and executed.
In the next iterations, we will have a non-blocking implementation to avoid the sub-agent being blocked by this operation.

There is no installation step or script execution, just extraction. We expect to support installation scripts in the future.

## Signature Verification

AC supports signature verifications. This assures users that a given agent was uploaded by the expected author and it hasn't been tampered.

The signature in the OCI repository follows the [Simple Signing format](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SIGNATURE_SPEC.md#payloads) (the only supported format) and it's been created with the [external tool process](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/signing_with_containers/#sign-and-upload-a-generated-payload-in-another-format-from-another-tool). 

> [!NOTE] 
> New Relic uses an owned repository. It doesn't need extra-services like [Rekor](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/) or [Fulcio](https://docs.sigstore.dev/certificate_authority/overview/). That's the reason why Agent Control uses the external tool process instead of `cosign sign`.

As a result of the "external tool process", the OCI repository will contain two packages. One for the agent and one for the signature. The signature package contains, among other things, the payload that was signed (in json format) and it's signature in base64. Inside the payload, we find the hash of the signed agent package. This is enough to verify the signature of an artifact, as we will see later.

Public keys are **ALWAYS** downloaded when verifying a signature. This avoids problems with outdated caches, like using a revoked key.
Public keys **MUST** be in JWKS format.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "alg": null,
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "key/0",
      "n": null,
      "e": null,
      "x": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "y": null,
      "crv": "Ed25519"
    },
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "alg": null,
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "key/1",
      "n": null,
      "e": null,
      "x": "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
      "y": null,
      "crv": "Ed25519"
    }
  ]
}
```

Verification flow:

    Note over AC: Step 3: Integrity Check
    AC->>AC: Compute downloaded artifact hash
    AC->>AC: Compare computed hash against the hash inside the payload

    Note over AC: Result: Package Verified & Trusted
```

## Key Rotation

What happens during a key rotation? It depends on the specific use case. AC tries to verify every signature in the signature-manifest layers with every public key published for that package, this approach avoids downtimes on key rotation. Note that a non-revoked key must exist on the list, otherwise signature verification will fail.

## Garbage collection

AC keeps track of the latest installed package. Each install operation executes an old package purge operation, which retains the latest tracked package (i.e. package currently running) and the new installed package. You can think of it like a FIFO with size 2. 

On restart, AC only retains the current package. The previous package will be deleted.

Example:

1. User installs infra agent version 1.0.0 (system stores infra 1.0.0)
2. User installs infra agent version 3.0.0 (system stores infra 1.0.0 and 3.0.0)
3. User installs infra agent version 2.0.0 (system stores infra 2.0.0 and 3.0.0)
4. Restart (system stores infra 2.0.0)

## Error Handling

**Installation Failures**:
- Sanitization error computing path suffix → Fail
- Installing archive errors → Delete partial installation directory then fail
  This includes the following errors
  - Create temporal download path error → Fail
  - Download error (includes signature verification errors) → Retry several times, then fail
  - Extract package → Fail
- Delete temporal package path → Fail
- Retain packages error → Fail

For signature verification, we only fail when BOTH signature verification is enabled (check the [Agent Control Configuration agent_packages section](./CONFIG.md#agent_packages)) AND a public key is configured (check the example in [AgentType `packages` section](./INTEGRATING_AGENTS.md#packages)), and the signature doesn't match. If signature verification is disabled OR no public key is configured, we skip verification and log a warning.

## Local Development

If needed, you can run a local OCI registry using [zot](https://github.com/project-zot/zot) with

```bash
$ ./tools/oci-registry.sh run  
```

Notice that AC is already configured to use HTTP as protocol when connecting to `localhost:5001` if executed/built __without__ `--release`.
