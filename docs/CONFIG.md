# Agent Control Configuration

Agent control will load the configuration from the file `local_config.yaml` in the corresponding directory (`/etc/newrelic-agent-control/local-data/agent-control/` or `/opt/homebrew/var/lib/newrelic-agent-control/local-data/agent-control/`).

Additionally, any configuration field can be set as an environment variable with the `NR_AC` prefix, using `__` to separate keys. Examples:

```bash
# Set log level to debug
NR_AC_LOG__LEVEL=DEBUG
# Set 'client_id' for the authentication config in the Fleet Control communication
NR_AC_FLEET_CONTROL__AUTH_CONFIG__CLIENT_ID="some-client-id"
```
## Environment Variables file (on-host)

Agent Control can load environment variables from a YAML file named `environment_variables.yaml` placed in the local configuration directory (`/etc/newrelic-agent-control/`, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-agent-control\`). 

Format: the file must be a flat YAML map of string keys to string values.

```yaml
# Example environment variables file
MY_ENV_VAR: "env var value"
HTTPS_PROXY: "http://proxy.local:8443"
NR_AC_LOG__LEVEL: "DEBUG"
```

Validation rules:
- Keys must match the regex `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` (letters, digits, and underscore; must start with a letter or underscore).
- Values must not contain NUL (`\0`) characters.
- Invalid entries cause startup to fail with an error.

Notes:
- This file is not watched; changes require restarting Agent Control.
- Use the `NR_AC_*` variables to override configuration fields via environment variables.
- Variables will be inherited by the Agents processes.


## Configuration fields

### agents

List of agents configured locally. Check of [DEVELOPMENT](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information regarding agents and their corresponding local configuration.

Example:

```yaml
agents:
  nrdot: "newrelic/com.newrelic.opentelemetry.collector:0.1.0"
```

### logs

Logs can be configured as follows:

```yaml
log:
  format:
    target: true # Defaults to false, includes extra information for debugging purposes
    timestamp: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M%S" # Defaults to "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M%S", details in <https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.40/chrono/format/strftime/index.html#fn7>
    ansi_colors: true # Defaults to false, set up ansi-colors in the stdout logs output.
    formatter: json # Defaults to "json". It accepts "json" (newline delimited JSON logs) or "pretty" (human-readable, single-line logs)
  level: debug # Defines the log level, defaults to "info".
  insecure_fine_grained_level: debug # Enables logs for external dependencies and sets its level. This cannot be considered secure since external dependencies may leek secrets. If this is set the 'level' field does not apply.
  file:
    enabled: true # Enabled logging to files.
    path: /some/path/logs.log # Optional path to write logs to, if not set it will use 'newrelic-agent-control.log' in the application logging directory.
  show_spans: false # Show spans information as logs. It includes additional details which may be useful for debugging purposes.
```

### fleet_control

This configuration field enables and sets up the remote configuration features of Agent Control.

```yaml
fleet_control:
  endpoint: https://opamp.service.newrelic.com/v1/opamp # Fleet control endpoint.
  auth_config:
    token_url: https://system-identity-oauth.service.newrelic.com/oauth2/token # Endpoint to obtain access token
    client_id: "some-client-id" # Auth client id associated with the private key
    provider: "local" # Local auth provider which will load the provided key from 'private_key_path'
    private_key_path: "/private/key/path" # Path to the private key corresponding to the client-id.
    retries: 3 # Number of retries if the authentication fails.
  fleet_id: "some-id" # Fleet identifier.
  signature_validation:
    enabled: true # Defaults to true, allows disabling the signature validation.
    public_key_server_url: "https://publickeys.newrelic.com/signing/blob-management/global/agentconfiguration" # Server to obtain the public key for signature validation.
```

### proxy

Agent Control will use the system proxy (configured through the standard `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables) but
proxy options can also be configured using the proxy configuration field. If both are set, the precedence works as follows:

1. `proxy` configuration field
2. `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable
3. `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable

```yaml
proxy:
  url: https://proxy.url:8080 # Proxy url in format '<protocol>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>'
  ca_bundle_dir: /some/dir # System path with CA certificates in PEM format (all '.pem' files in the directory will be read).
  ca_bundle_file: /some/pem/file # System path with CA certificates in PEM format.
  ignore_system_proxy: false # Default to false, if set to true HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables will be ignored.
```

#### ⚠️ Proxy configuration for Agents

Configuring a proxy in Agent Control does not automatically configure the same proxy settings for the agents it manages. Each agent has its own proxy configuration that must be set separately according to that agent's specific configuration format and requirements.

The only exception is the infrastructure agent, which will inherit the proxy settings from Agent Control whenever the configuration is generated via the Cli.

### server

Agent Control status server allows consulting the status of Agent Control and any controlled agent. It can be configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  port: 51200 # Port for the status server. Defaults to 51200.
  host: "127.0.0.1" # Host for the status server. Defaults to '127.0.0.1'.
  enabled: true # The status server is enabled by default
```

### health_check

Configuration fields to set-up Agent Control health-check

```yaml
health_check:
  interval: 120s # Defaults to 30s
  initial_delay: 120s # Defaults to 30s
```

### self_instrumentation

Agent Control can be configured to instrument itself and report traces, logs and metrics through OpenTelemetry. If proxy is configured globally it will also apply to self-instrumentation.

```yaml
self_instrumentation:
  opentelemetry:
    insecure_level: "newrelic_agent_control=info,off" # It is considered insecure because setting it up for external dependencies could potentially leak secrets. The default `newrelic_agent_control=debug,opamp_client=debug,off` disables external dependencies and can be considered secure.
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:4318 # HTTPS endpoint to report instrumentation to.
    headers: {} # Headers that will be included in any request to the endpoint
    client_timeout: 10s # Timeout for performing requests, defaults to 30s.
    custom_attributes: {} # Attributes to be decorated in all metrics, traces and logs
    metrics:
      enabled: true # Defaults to false.
      interval: 120s # Interval to report metrics, it defaults to 60s.
    traces:
      enabled: true # Defaults to false.
      batch_config:
        scheduled_delay: 30s # Set the scheduled delay for batch export of traces. Defaults to 30s.
        max_size: 512 # Se the maximum number of traces to process in a single batch. Defaults to 512.
    logs:
      enabled: true # Defaults to false.
      batch_config:
        scheduled_delay: 30s # Set the scheduled delay for batch export of logs. Defaults to 30s.
        max_size: 512 # Se the maximum number of logs to process in a single batch. Defaults to 512.
```

### host_id

If the `host_id` is set it will be used to identify the host in Fleet Control instead of trying to fetch the identifier from the
host where Agent Control is running. Order of precedence:

1. Configured `host_id`.
2. Cloud instance id.
3. Machine id.

This applies for on-host environments only:

```yaml
host_id: "some-host-id" # Defaults to "" (no host set).
```

### k8s

The `k8s` configuration field applies for k8s environments only and are automatically set up through the corresponding helm chart:

```yaml
k8s:
  cluster_name: "some-cluster-name" # Required, used to identify the cluster in Fleet Control.
  namespace: "default" # Required, namespace where all resources managed by Agent Control will be created.
  namespace_agents: "default-agents" # Required, namespace where all sub-agents managed by Agent Control will be created.
  current_chart_version: "0.0.50-dev" # Chart version used to deploy agent-control, it will be reported to Fleet Control and used to check if a remote update should be applied.
  ac_remote_update: true # When disabled remote updates for Agent Control are ignored.
  ac_release_name: agent-control-deployment # Informs of the 'Agent Control' release name that needs to be updated on remote updates and when checking health. If it is empty, the healthiness of Agent Control will not be checked.
  cd_remote_update: true # When disabled remote updates for the Agent Control CD are ignored. Besides, the health of this component is not checked.
  cd_release_name: agent-control-cd  # Informs of the 'Agent Control CD' release name that needs to be updated on remote updates and when checking health. If it is empty, the healthiness of Agent Control CD will not be checked.
```

Notice that some of the fields in `k8s` are passed by the corresponding helm chart via Environment Variable to avoid race conditions.
If set via config, after a failed upgrade we could have the "old" pod loading the new config and reading the new chart version, while the image is still the old one.

### agent_type_var_constraints

Allows setting up specific constraints in the agent types variables supporting it.

- `variants`: if any agent-type defines a string variable with the `variants` fields and this configuration field defines the corresponding key. These variants will be used to validate values.

See [variants documentation](/docs/INTEGRATING_AGENTS.md#variants-optional) for concrete example.

### secrets_providers

The `secrets_providers` configuration field sets the configuration for the supported secrets providers. Users can use the values stored in secrets in their remote configurations.

```yaml
secrets_providers:
  vault: # Sets vault sources configuration
    sources: # Each entry identified by the key defines a source with url, token and engine.
      source1:
        url: https://vault1.url # Vault url for the source
        token: secret-token-1 # token for authentication
        engine: kv1 # engine (kv1 and kv2 are supported)
      source1:
        url: https://vault2.url
        token: secret-token-2
        engine: kv2
```

### agent_packages

This field configures packages behaviour.

```yaml
agent_packages:
  signature_verification_enabled: # Optional, enabled by default, sets whether packages signatures will be verified or not, when set to false a warning is logged
```
